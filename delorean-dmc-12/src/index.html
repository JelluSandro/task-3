                    in Your name,
                    cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?́</div>
                    And then I will declare to them, «I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice
                    lawlessness!́
                    «Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to
                    a wise man who built his house on the rock:
                    Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine,
                    lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.
                    «Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock,
                    nd it will be opened to you.
                    For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him
                    who knocks it will be opened.
                    Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread,
                    will give him a stone?
                    Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?
                    If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your
                    children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good
                    things to those who ask Him!
                    Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them,
                    for this is the Law and the Prophets.

                    And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people
                    were astonished at His teaching,
                    for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
                    At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus
                    and said to his servants, «This is John the Baptist; he is risen from
                    the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.»
                    For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison for the
                    sake of Herodias, his brother Philiṕs wife.
                    Because John had said to him, «It is not lawful for you to have her.»
                    And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because
                    they counted him as a prophet.
                    But when Herod́s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced
                    before them and pleased Herod.
                    Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
                    So she, having been prompted by her mother, said, «Give me John the
                    Baptist́s head here on a platter.»
                    And the king was sorry; nevertheless, because of the oaths and because
                    of those who sat with him, he commanded it to be given to her.
                    So he sent and had John beheaded in prison.
                    And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she
                    brought it to her mother.
                    Then his disciples came and took away the body and buried it, and went
                    and told Jesus.
                    When Jesus heard it, He departed from there by boat to a deserted
                    place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they
                    followed Him on foot from the cities.
                    And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved
                    with compassion for them, and healed their sick.
                    When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, <div class="quote">«
                    This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send
