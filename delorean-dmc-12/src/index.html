                But when Herod́s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced
                before them and pleased Herod.
                Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
                So she, having been prompted by her mother, said, «Give me John the
                Baptist́s head here on a platter.»
                And the king was sorry; nevertheless, because of the oaths and because
                of those who sat with him, he commanded it to be given to her.
                So he sent and had John beheaded in prison.
                And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she
                brought it to her mother.
                Then his disciples came and took away the body and buried it, and went
                and told Jesus.
                When Jesus heard it, He departed from there by boat to a deserted
                place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they
                followed Him on foot from the cities.
                And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved
                with compassion for them, and healed their sick.
                When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, «
                This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send
                the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.»
